- Static site designed as a walkthrough for pulling data for YouTube API.
- Test account info in assignment comments.

## Install 
To display backend data
```
 npm install
 $node ./search/index.js
```
## User Story
Teacher/Students going through a coding coarse that might like to refer back to helpful tutorial videos in one location.
## Task Flow
 - Compile a YouTube channel with videos that have relevant information to the educational material studied in class.
 - Give out login information so everyone can add more videos to different playlists.
 - Can be pulled from database or API to post on instructional website where all other relevant class material is already posted.
## Summary
I believe having a library of videos that students and instructors find useful when going through coding programs would be extremely beneficial. Everything could be hosted and located on one site rather than having to go and browse through 1000's of videos for the information that you want, this is something that could easily be continously updated and maintained by those using it. If information is no longer relevant to the coarse it can be removed easily. To go along with this the videos shared in the playlists would be directly relevant to what students take in the class.
## YouTube Playlist Instructions
1. Navigate to [Youtube](youtube.com)
2. Login into YouTube account
3. Navigate to relevant video you would like to add to playlists
4. Click the +SAVE button
5. Either add the video to an existing playlist or create a new one
6. If creating a new playlist add new title and description
## YouTube API
- [Getting Started](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started)
- [Documentation](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs)
- [Credentials](https://developers.google.com/youtube/registering_an_application)
- [Playlist Endpoints](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/playlists)

## Issues
- Could not figure out a good way to get the backend code to push to frontend, all of the other tutorials I found showed the API keys.
- Instead made a static page explaining how to set up backend code for use with your choice of database host.
- Started to use SASS but I think I did something wrong at set up or am precompiling it incorrectly to css. The SCSS is working just not with SASS Syntax.
